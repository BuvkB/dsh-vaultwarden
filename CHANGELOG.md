# Changelog

All notable changes to `dsh-vaultwarden` are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-29

First public release as an **independent project** (not a fork). It talks to the
Bitwarden/Vaultwarden REST + SignalR protocols directly: no `bw` CLI, no runtime
dependencies beyond an optional `hash-wasm` (Argon2id KDF).

### Added

- **WebSocket real-time sync** — subscribes to `/notifications/hub` (SignalR),
  debounces bursts by 400 ms, then pulls `/api/sync` and re-decrypts the cache.
  Falls back to polling when the hub is unreachable and **periodically retries
  upgrading back** to WebSocket; honours `LogOut` notifications; backs off on
  429.
- **Write-back** — `bitwarden_create` / `bitwarden_update` / `bitwarden_delete`
  (soft delete by default, `permanent` to purge), personal items only.
- **Entry browser panel** — a settings page with search, a hierarchical
  list → detail flow, copy buttons, live TOTP countdown, and a reprompt gate for
  entries that require re-verification.
- **Three write-permission tiers** — `readonly` (default, refuses every write),
  `ask` (each write goes through the host approval seam; denied when no approval
  channel is composed), `auto` (writes directly).
- **Guided setup + sign-in forms** — server URL, email, master password, and an
  optional sign-in method switch to **API key** (`user.<uuid>` + secret), which
  bypasses two-factor. Credentials are verified before being stored, and only
  changed fields are written.
- **Two-factor login** — password is verified first; the code screen is reached
  only afterwards. A rejected code keeps the user on that screen to retry, and
  the challenge is refreshed automatically when it expires.
- **Session persistence** (`sessionDays`, default 30) — the token, refresh token
  and derived master key are stored in
  `~/.dsh/data/dsh-vaultwarden/session.json` (`0600`), so plugin and harness
  restarts no longer require a password or a new code. Expiry is **idle-based**:
  every use slides the window, and only 30 idle days invalidate it. Set `0` to
  disable.
- **Clickable sync chip** — click to sync immediately; hover for sync mode,
  connection state, poll interval, last signal/sync times and the last error.
- Six global tools — `bitwarden_find`, `bitwarden_get`, `bitwarden_status`,
  `bitwarden_sync`, plus the three write tools — and a system-prompt section that
  teaches every session to consult the vault before asking the user.

### Security

- The panel reads through the authenticated `/api` connection RPC channel
  (`vw/*`); the plugin deliberately serves **no HTTP route of its own**, so it
  cannot bypass the operator's session.
- Secret fields (master password, API key secret) are marked `secret`: never
  echoed back to the UI, never written to logs.
- WebAuthn / passkeys are **not supported**: they require a browser and a user
  gesture on an authenticator, which a headless process cannot perform. Use an
  API key instead — it bypasses two-factor entirely.

### Notes

- `peerDependencies` use explicit prerelease branches
  (`>=0.1.0-rc.1 <0.3.0-0`) so rc builds of DSH resolve correctly.
- Verified against Vaultwarden 2026.6.0 (`/notifications/hub` reachable,
  two-factor account, 431 entries).
- 204 offline tests across seven suites (`bash scripts/build.sh`).
